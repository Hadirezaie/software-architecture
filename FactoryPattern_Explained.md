# Introduction to Factory Pattern
The **Factory Pattern** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects while allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code.

**Key Concept:**
"Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate."
