# Difference Between Design Principles and Design Patterns

When learning software design, it's important to understand the difference between **Design Principles** and **Design Patterns**. Here is a clear explanation:

---

## What are Design Principles?

Design Principles are **fundamental guidelines or rules** that help developers write clean, maintainable, scalable, and understandable code. They represent high-level philosophies that can be applied regardless of programming language or framework.

**Examples:**

- **SOLID** (A set of object-oriented design principles)
- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

These principles promote better code quality and reduce bugs by guiding the design process.

---

## What are Design Patterns?

Design Patterns are **reusable solutions** to common problems encountered during software design. They are more concrete than principles, providing specific templates or structures to solve particular design issues.

**Examples:**

- **Singleton** (Ensures a class has only one instance)
- **Observer** (Defines a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects of changes)
- **Factory** (Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic)
- **Decorator** (Adds behavior to objects dynamically)

Patterns are often built upon design principles.

## Summary Table

| Aspect               | Design Principles                      | Design Patterns                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Nature               | High-level guidelines and philosophies | Concrete, reusable design solutions      |
| Level of Abstraction | More abstract                          | More specific and structural             |
| Purpose              | Improve overall design quality         | Solve specific recurring design problems |
| Examples             | SOLID, DRY, KISS                       | Singleton, Observer, Factory, Decorator  |
