# Singleton Pattern â€“ Detailed Explanation

## What is the Singleton Pattern?

The **Singleton Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** that ensures a class has **only one instance** and provides a **global point of access** to that instance.

### Why use Singleton?

- When you want to control access to some shared resource (e.g., configuration, logging, database connection).
- To ensure that there is exactly one object managing a specific task.
- To save memory by reusing the single instance instead of creating multiple ones.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Single Instance:** Only one object of the class is created.
2. **Global Access:** The instance is accessible globally through a well-known access point (usually a static method).
3. **Lazy Initialization:** The instance is created when it is first needed (optional optimization).
4. **Thread Safety:** In multithreaded environments, special care is needed to ensure only one instance is created.

## How Singleton is Implemented

- Make the class constructor **private** to prevent external instantiation.
- Create a **static variable** inside the class to hold the single instance.
- Provide a **public static method** (e.g., `getInstance()`) that returns the single instance.

## Example in Java

```public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

// Usage:
Singleton s1 = Singleton.getInstance();
Singleton s2 = Singleton.getInstance();

System.out.println(s1 == s2);  // true

```
