# Introduction to Factory Pattern
The **Factory Pattern** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects while allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code.

**Key Concept:**
"Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate."

## Benefits of Using Factory Pattern

- Reduced Coupling: Client code doesn't depend on concrete implementations.
- Centralized Object Creation: Creation logic is encapsulated in one place.
- Enhanced Flexibility: New product types can be added easily.
- Improved Maintainability: Changes to object creation affect only the factory.
- Simplified Complex Initialization: Factories can handle complex setup logic.

## Structure of Factory Pattern
**Components:**
1. ***Product Interface/Abstract Class:*** Defines the common interface for objects.
2. ***Concrete Products:*** Implementations of the product interface.
3. ***Factory Class:*** Contains the creation logic.
4. ***Client:*** Uses the factory to create objects.
